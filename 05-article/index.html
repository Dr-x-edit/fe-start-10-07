              </h3>
              <p class="box-right__text">
                In June this year, hundreds of Australian shoppers queued – some
                overnight – to buy a pair of Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Black Static
                Adidas sneakers the moment they went on sale. Before lining up,
                customers had to register and go into a draw to determine
                whether they could buy a pair. The shoes sold for a few hundred
                dollars but are now being traded for up to a $3000. This quest
                to obtain limited edition sneakers designed by rapper Kanye West
                is not an isolated phenomenon. People have long gone to extreme
                lengths to get their hands on the latest kicks. There have been
                reports of sneaker violence since the 1980s.

                A brief history
              </h3>
              <p class="box-left__text">
                The first sneakers appeared in 1830s England, when Liverpool
                Rubber bonded a canvas outer onto a vulcanised rubber sole,
                creating the original sand shoe for the Victorian middle classes
                to wear on the beach. Different styles of the shoe were
                developed in the UK and the US throughout the 19th century to
                respond to athletic pursuits like running, tennis, jumping and
                sailing. The term “sneaker” was coined in the US in the 1870 to
                describe the shoe because it was noiseless. Athletes in Paris
                wore sneakers at the first modern Olympic Games in 1900.

                Sneakers today
              </h3>
              <p class="box-right__text">
                The current nostalgia in sneakers extends to design imagery,
                styles, and colour combinations. In April this year, Adidas
                issued a limited edition version of the My Adidas Superstar 1986
                sneaker. <br />
                Luxury brands have also taken note, capitalising on historical
                references, status concerns and a relaxation in social dress
                codes. Leading high-fashion brands, including Chanel, Louis
                Vuitton and Balenciaga now consider sneakers a must-have fashion
                item in their collections. Where once 1980s women swapped their
                commuter sneakers for power heels at the office, people now wear
                their sneakers all day.

                Sustainability and ethical production
              </h3>
              <p class="box-left__text">
                While many sneaker fans continue to prioritise style over
                environmental concerns, others are demanding transparency around
                the ethics and impact of production, leading to the rise of the
                sustainable sneaker. Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, favours Veja
                sneakers made from wild Amazonian rainforest rubber. Adidas has
                been making sneakers using recycled ocean plastic since 2015,
                but says it wants to go further. It launched the Futurecraft
                Loop in April, a sneaker made exclusively from 100% reusable
                Thermoplastic polyurethane that can be recycled again and again.

                Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars, first marketed in 1917, are the
                all-time best-selling sneakers, with total sales nearing 600

                Supply and demand
              </h3>
              <p class="box-right__text">
                One key to enduring sneaker love is scarcity. Adidas only
                released 1986 of their limited-edition My Adidas Superstar 1986
                shoes. West also generates exclusivity with low production
                numbers – only 40,000 pairs of Yeezys are made worldwide for
                each drop and shops in Australia may only have 25 pairs of each
                incarnation. The combination of rarity, and the myriad cultural
                meanings embedded in sneakers creates an emotional pull for
                collectors like DJ Jerome Salele’a that ties them to sneaker,
                hip-hop, skater and rave communities around the globe. The
                ultimate sneaker is a comfortable vehicle for the body to move
                through the world that expresses the wearer’s desires, dreams
                and aspirations and crosses social, geographic and language
                boundaries.
